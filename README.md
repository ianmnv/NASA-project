# NASA-Project

This project is created with the intention of deploying space missions using real NASA data with the power of React and Express. Basically a full-stack application to find exoplanets for the future of humanity.

## Back-end

In the back-end of this project, a lot of good practices are implemented, like the MVC pattern, the Separation of concerns design principle, using the CRUD operations correctly and a lot more that makes the back-end maintainable and scaleable.

### Scripts

To run the project in development mode, run:

### `npm run watch`

All commands described here have to run from the root's folder, otherwise take a look at the commands for the front-end (client folder) or for the back-end (server folder). A better approach to run the client or the server separately, run the following commands accordingly:

### `npm run client`

OR

### `npm run server`

To install dependencies for all the project:

### `npm install`

Or individually:

### `npm run install-client`

OR

### `npm run install-server`

If you want to see the project in production mode, you have to go to the http://localhost:8000 manually after you ran this command:

### `npm run deploy`

Which will create the 'build' folder in your server folder.
